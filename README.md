# Ruby Challenges / The Wiley Word Square

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Ruby Challenges](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/ruby-challenges) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

Difficulty: **Hard.**

Write a program to find the largest possible square of letters such that every row forms a word (reading left to right) and every column forms a word (reading top to bottom).

Sound easy? See if you can find a 7x7 in under 30 seconds.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/the-wiley-word-square.git
    cd the-wiley-word-square
    bin/setup

Write a program to find the largest possible square of letters such that every row forms a word (reading left to right) and every column forms a word (reading top to bottom).

Here's an example:
```
cat
are
bee
```

Sound easy? See if you can find a 6x6 in under a minute.

# What you'll learn

This challenge will expose you to a useful and interesting data structure, as well as force you to think about how to solve a somewhat-complicated problem. Completing this exercise will improve your ability to design algorithms to solve problems.

# Resources

* A `words.lst` file is provided. Use this as your dictionary.
* You might find a [trie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) to be a useful data structure for this challenge. The [algorithms gem](https://github.com/kanwei/algorithms) has a nice implementation of one.
* You might also find [this Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_square) helpful.

# Submitting

Include a file called `best_result` with the largest square you found and how long it took.
